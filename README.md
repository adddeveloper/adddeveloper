Hi there
I am Adnan, a front-end developer.
I don't do much other than learn and code..
so, there is really nothing about me. 
      
    For all those who want to know:
        I code in HTML, CSS (bootstrap), Vanilla Javascript (I am bad in this language).
	I am planning on  learning SQL (already know some), PHP (already know some), Java (most likely through youtube), Python (course in school)
